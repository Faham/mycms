<p>
<span class="course">CMPT 105.3 - Introduction to Computing and Interactive Systems Design</span>
<br />
Introduction to ideas and concepts in computer science and the design of interactive systems. Concepts in computing such as algorithms, problem solving, and programming are explored using interactive multimedia systems as the focus. Basic concepts in design and interaction, such as the interaction cycle, event-based behaviour, and prototyping are introduced.
<br />
<i>Note:</i> CMPT 105 can be taken as a science course by non-science majors. Science majors may not receive science credit for this course. CMPT 105 can be taken for credit after completion of CMPT 100 or 102; but CMPT 100 and 102 cannot be taken for credit after completion of CMPT 105.

<p>
<span class="course">CMPT 106.3 - Design and Construction of Games and Interactive Systems</span>
<br />
Introduces additional basic concepts in computer science and interaction design, building on the algorithmic foundation of CMPT 105, and adding topics such as representation of data, use of expressions, development of subprograms, and creation and manipulation of graphical images. Design topics include consideration of narrative, game rules, collaboration, and animation.
<br />
<i>Prerequisite(s):</i> CMPT 105 or (until 2010, CMPT 100).
