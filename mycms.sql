However, instrumenting software to collect usage data is a time-intensive task that often requires technical expertise as well as an understanding of the usability issues to be explored. We have developed a new technique for software instrumentation that removes the need for programming. <i>Interactive Usability Instrumentation</i> (IUI) allows usability evaluators to work directly with a system''s interface to specify what components and what events should be logged. Evaluators are able to create higher-level abstractions on the events they log and are provided with real-time feedback on how events are logged. As a proof of the IUI concept, we have created the UMARA system, an instrumentation system that is enabled by recent advances in aspect-oriented programming. UMARA allows users to instrument software without the need for additional coding, and provides tools for specification, data collection, and data analysis. We report on the use of UMARA in the instrumentation of two large open-source projects; our experiences show that IUI can substantially simplify the process of log-based usability evaluation.', 2009, NULL, 0, '', '', '', 'Pittsburgh, PA', '', '', '', 'Proceedings of the ACM SIGCHI Symposium on Engineering Interactive Computer Systems Systems (EICS 2009)', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'uploads/1-eics119-bateman.pdf', 'uploads/1-iui-eics-figure.mp4'),

The system uses a special digital pen, which writes ''real'' ink on the palettes while functioning as a digital input device on the interactive surfaces.

One of the main benefits of this process is that people can be more sensitive to issues of privacy and interruption while they are moving towards interaction. However, on-line communication tools do not provide this subtlety, and often lead to unwanted interruptions. We have developed a prototype message system called OpenMessenger (OM) that adds the idea of gradual initiation of interaction to online communication. OpenMessenger provides multiple levels of awareness about people, and provides notification to those about whom information is being gathered. OpenMessenger allows people to negotiate interaction in a richer fashion than is possible with any other current messaging system.

Stitching is the method used by most operating systems; in this technique, the cursor jumps from the edge of one display directly into the next display. In contrast, Mouse Ether maps the motor space of the mouse exactly to the physical space of the displays, meaning that the cursor has to travel across displayless space until it reaches the next display. To determine which of these approaches is best for cross-display movement, we carried out a study comparing Stitching, Mouse Ether, and a variant of Mouse Ether with Halo for off-screen feedback. We found that Stitching is equivalent to or faster than any variant of Mouse Ether, and that Halo improves Ether''s performance (but not enough to outperform Stitching).

However, paper-based maps pose several challenges for researchers, such as difficulties with anticipating and printing the necessary paper maps, observing and recording community member''s interactions with maps, and effectively archiving new geographical information after the session is complete. Since community elders are mostly non-interactive with technology, new technologies that require explicit interaction will not be readily patronized by the community. Furthermore, due to factors including age and culture, elders are unlikely to use new technologies of any kind. Thus, any improvement on the paper-based interaction paradigm must satisfy researcher''s needs for a simple map navigation interface as well as greater ease and accuracy in recording interactions while maintaining as low a technological profile as possible.\r\nWe interviewed four researchers in biology and veterinary medicine whose primary research takes place in the north with community members to determine the most effective mechanisms for presenting and eliciting geographical information during northern research without altering the existing interaction paradigm.

This variation is attributed to factors such as the presence of colour blindness. Colour is used to encode information in information visualizations. An example of such an encoding is categorization using colour (e.g., green for land, blue for water).\r\nAs a result of the variation in colour differentiation ability among individuals, many people experience difficulties when using colour-encoded information visualiza- tions. These difficulties result from the inability to adequately differentiate between two colours, resulting in confusion, errors, frustration, and dissatisfaction.\r\nIf a user-specific model of colour differentiation was available, these difficulties could be predicted and corrected. Prediction and correction of these difficulties would reduce the amount of confusion, errors, frustration, and dissatisfaction experienced by users. This thesis presents a model of colour differentiation that is tuned to the abilities of a particular user. To construct this model, a series of judgement tasks are performed by the user. The data from these judgement tasks is used to calibrate a general colour differentiation model to the user. This calibrated model is used to construct a predictor. This predictor can then be used to make predictions about the user''s ability to differentiate between two colours.\r\nTwo participant-based studies were used to evaluate this solution.

Creating an API which programmers enjoy to use but also allows the programmers to be productive while doing so is an important aspect of API design.

We use our results to identify the limitations of current embodiment techniques in supporting deixis, and to propose new hybrid designs that can better represent the range of behavior seen in real-world settings.', 2011, NULL, 0, '', '', '', 'Aarhus, Denmark', '253-271', '', '', 'ECSCW 2011', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'uploads/210-GestureCharacterization_Final.pdf', NULL),

Without calibration, user performance can degrade (e.g., if an input device is not adjusted for the user''s abilities), errors can increase (e.g., if color spaces are not matched), and some interactions may not be possible (e.g., use of an eye tracker). The value of calibration is often lost, however, because many calibration processes are tedious and unenjoyable, and many users avoid them altogether. To address this problem, we propose calibration games that gather calibration data in an engaging and entertaining manner. To facilitate the creation of calibration games, we present design guidelines that map common types of calibration to core tasks, and then to well-known game mechanics. To evaluate the approach, we developed three calibration games and com- pared them to standard procedures. Users found the game versions significantly more enjoyable than regular calibration procedures, without compromising the quality of the data.

To address this limitation, we have developed a new situation-specific model of human color differentiation (called ICD-2) that needs far fewer calibration trials. The new model uses a color space that better matches human color vision compared to the RGB space of the old model, and can therefore extract more meaning from each calibration test.

First, we compared its accuracy with that of the existing models, and found that the personalized simulations were significantly more accurate than the old method. Second, we asked pairs of participants (one with CVD, and one close friend or family member without CVD) to discuss images of everyday scenes that had been simulated with the CVD person''s particular model.

Biofeedback games have seen success when used in special populations - for example, to help children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) learn to focus or to help children with anxiety learn to manage their stress levels - however, creating engaging biofeedback games is difficult because they traditionally alter a game''s mechanics to create the feedback loop. This means that each game must be custom designed, which is both expensive and time consuming. Thus, biofeedback games tend to be toy applications that don''t hold a user''s interest in the long term, which is a problem because biofeedback training requires repeated exposure.\r\n\r\nWe propose to solve the problem of creating good biofeedback games by closing the biofeedback loop by altering game graphics instead of game mechanics. We present a graphical overlay on top of a running game that disrupts the user from playing when not in the desired physiological state by obscuring the game screen. The amount of disruption varies in a continuous manner, is determined during play, and is driven by the physiological sensors. Our graphical overlays can be chosen from a set or be customized to be consistent with the visual style of the game, and are consistent with abstract in-game visualizations that already exist and players are familiar with using (e.g., tunnel vision representing poor in-game health). Our solution turns off-the-shelf games into biofeedback games, leveraging the millions of dollars and years of development that go into triple-A titles, and ensuring an engaging play experience.\r\n\r\nOur solution is considered effective if the biofeedback games created are engaging to play (i.e., our system does not break the flow that the game studios designed in', 2012, NULL, 0, '', '', '', 'Montreal', '', '', '', 'GRAND 2012', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'uploads/282-Grand-Poster-2012---Upload.pdf', NULL),

AFEC can maintain a predefined level of reliability while avoiding the overhead of packet acknowledgement or retransmission. We analysed the requirements of typical real-time groupware systems and developed an AFEC technique to meet these needs. We tested the new technique in an experiment that measured message reliability and latency using TCP, plain UDP, UDP with non-adaptive FEC, and UDP with our AFEC scheme, under several simulated network conditions. Our results show that for awareness messages that can tolerate some loss, FEC approaches keep latency at nearly the plain-UDP level while dramatically improving reliability.

Traditionally, people with CVD have been supported by recolouring tools that improve colour differentiability, but do not consider the subjective properties of colour schemes while recolouring. To address this, we developed SPRWeb, a tool that recolours websites to preserve subjective responses and improve colour differentiability - thus enabling users with CVD to have similar online experiences. To develop SPRWeb, we extended existing models of non-CVD subjective responses to CVD, then used this extended model to steer the recolouring process. In a lab study, we found that SPRWeb did significantly better than a standard recolouring tool at preserving the temperature and naturalness of websites, while achieving similar weight and differentiability preservation.

Recoloring tools have been developed to address the problem, but current recolorers are limited in that they work from a model of only one type of congenital CVD (i.e., dichromatism). This model does not adequately describe many other forms of CVD (e.g., more common congenital deficiencies such as anomalous trichromacy, acquired deficiencies such as cataracts or age-related yellowing of the lens, or temporary deficiencies such as wearing tinted glasses or working in bright sunlight), and so standard recolorers work poorly in many situations. In this article we describe an alternate approach that can address these limitations. The new approach, called Situation-Specific Modeling (SSM), constructs a model of a specific user''s color differentiation abilities in a specific situation, and uses that model as the basis for recoloring digital presentations. As a result, SSM can inherently handle all types of CVD, whether congenital, acquired, or environmental. In this article we describe and evaluate several models that are based on the SSM approach. Our first model of individual color differentiation (called ICD-1) works in RGB color space, and a user study showed it to be accurate and robust (both for users with and without congenital CVD). However, three aspects of ICD-1 were identified as needing improvement: the calibration step needed to build the situation-specific model, and the prediction steps used in recoloring were too slow for real-world use; and the results of the model''s predictions were too coarse for some uses.

Even though information seeking is extremely common, there are many times when these tasks are unsuccessful, because the information found is less than ideal or the task could have been completed more efficiently. In unsuccessful information-seeking tasks, there are often other people who have knowledge or experience that could help improve task success. However, information seekers do not typically look for help from others, because tasks can often be completed alone (even if inefficiently). One of the problems is that web tools provide people with few opportunities to learn from one another''s experiences in ways that would allow them to improve their success. This dissertation presents the idea of social feedback. Social feedback is based on the theory of social learning, which describes how people learn from observing others. In social feedback, observational learning is enabled through the mechanism of interaction history - the traces of activity people create as they interact with the Web. Social feedback systems collect and display interaction history to allow information seekers to learn how to complete their tasks more successfully by observing how other people have behaved in similar situations. The dissertation outlines the design of two social-feedback systems, and describes two studies that demonstrate the real world applicability and feasibility of the idea. The first system supports global learning, by allowing people to learn new search skills and techniques that improve information seeking success in many different tasks. The second system supports local learning, in which people learn how to accomplish specific tasks more effectively and more efficiently.

These systems often implement relative forms of ray-cast pointing, in which the user simply points a hand-held input device towards targets on the screen. Ray-casting interaction is easy for novices to learn and understand, but this technique often suffers from accuracy problems: for example, hand jitter, arm fatigue, calibration drift, or lack of skill can all reduce people''s ability to acquire and select on-screen targets. In this paper, we analyse and evaluate the idea of target assistance as a way to address the accuracy problems of ray-cast pointing. Although several assistance schemes have been proposed for mouse-based pointing, these ideas have not been tested in distant-pointing settings, and there is little knowledge available to guide design in this increasingly common interaction scenario. To establish this basic design knowledge, we carried out four studies of relative ray-casting using three different target assistance techniques - two motor-space techniques (sticky targets and a novel form of target gravity), and one acquisition-feedback technique that combined visual, tactile, and auditory feedback.

Deictic pointing is important in the real world; it is also important in collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) because CVEs are 3D virtual environments that resemble the real world. CVEs connect people from different locations, allowing them to communicate and collaborate remotely. However, the interaction and communication capabilities of CVEs are not as good as those in the real world. In CVEs, people interact with each other using avatars (the visual representations of users). One problem of avatars is that they are not expressive enough when compare to what we can do in the real world. In particular, deictic pointing has many limitations and is not well supported.\r\n\r\nThis dissertation focuses on improving the expressiveness of distant pointing--where referents are out of reach--in desktop CVEs. This is done by developing a framework that guides the design and development of pointing techniques; by identifying important aspects of distant pointing through observation of how people point at distant referents in the real world; by designing, implementing, and evaluating distant-pointing techniques; and by providing a set of guidelines for the design of distant pointing in desktop CVEs.\r\n\r\nThe evaluations of distant-pointing techniques examine whether pointing without extra visual effects (natural pointing) has sufficient accuracy; whether people can control free arm movement (free pointing) along with other avatar actions; and whether free and natural pointing are useful and valuable in desktop CVEs.\r\n\r\nOverall, this research provides better support for deictic pointing in CVEs by improving the expressiveness of distant pointing. With better pointing support, gestural communication can be more effective and can ultimately enhance the primary function of CVEs--supporting distributed collaboration.', 2013, NULL, 0, '', '', '', 'Saskatoon, SK', '', '', 'http://hdl.handle.ne', '', '', '', '', '', 'University of Saskatchewan', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'uploads/314-WONG-DISSERTATION.pdf', NULL),

In order to get these benefits, it is recommended that people perform at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a day; however, many people do not get the recommended amount of exercise per day, which can result in health problems such as obesity and chronic disease. In this thesis, we propose a new genre of games called casual exergames, which we define as exergames that are designed to motivate people to exercise in small chunks of time multiple times throughout the day. Casual exergames have three advantages. First, games have been shown to have a strong motivation pull to play (i.e., people enjoy playing games), and casual games - those designed to be played in small chunks of time - have seen huge market success. Thus, we feel that applying casual game design to exergames will provide players with an enjoyable experience while performing physical activity. Second, research supports the approach of breaking exercise into small chunks, as the physical benefits of three moderate-intensity short bouts of physical activity (each lasting about 10 minutes) are similar to those of one continuous 30-minute bout. Thus, there should be physical benefits of casual exergame play. Third, short bouts of exercise have been shown to yield acute cognitive benefits. Thus a well-designed casual exergame should also produce measurable benefits to cognition. Following this approach, we designed and implemented a causal exergame called GrabApple, using the Microsoft Kinect sensor to detect body movement. Through the evaluation of GrabApple (carried out in three research studies), we show that a well-designed casual exergame can: 1) yield physical activity levels (similar to exercise on a treadmill) that meet the guidelines for moderate-intensity physical activity; 2) produce significant acute benefits to cognition over playing a sedentary versi', 2012, NULL, 0, '', '', '', 'Saskatoon, SK', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'University of Saskatchewan', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

The goal of these policies is to enable the user to make informed decisions about the disclosure of personal information in web-based transactions. However, these privacy policies are complex, requiring that a user agent evaluate conformance between the user''s privacy preferences and the site''s privacy policy, and indicate this conformance information to the user. The problem addressed in this thesis is that even with machine-readable policies and current user agents, it is still difficult for users to determine the cause and origin of a conflict between privacy preferences and privacy policies. The problem arises partly because current standards operate at the page level: they do not allow a fine-grained treatment of conformance down to the level of a specific field in a web form. In this thesis the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) is extended to enable field-level comparisons, field-specific conformance displays, and faster access to additional field-specific conformance information. An evaluation of a prototype agent based on these extensions showed that they allow users to more easily understand how the website privacy policy relates to the user''s privacy preferences, and where conformance conflicts occur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contact <a href="mailto:gutwin@cs.usask.ca">Carl Gutwin</a> if you would like more infor', 'past', 34),

We conducted a survey that asked people what amount of information from different sources that they would disclose to seven different relationship types. We found that in more than half of the cases, people would give different amounts of information to different relationships.

Using the information gathered by looking through the window, they can determine whether it is a good time to initiate a conversation with the occupant. There are, however, two problems with ordinary glass windows. First, there are times when the window does not provide enough information, such as when the occupant is away. Second, there is potential to violate the occupantâ€™s privacy; as a result of the privacy risk, people often cover their windows entirely. If office windows are to work efficiently as a support for collaboration, there must be a balance between awareness and privacy. In this research, I augmented the functions of a physical office window with a computer-mediated replacement called the Magic Window. The Magic Window collects video of the occupant, mediates the signal in various ways, and then presents the altered view on a screen that replaces the glass window. The Magic Window provides a better balance of awareness and privacy in office settings by allowing occupant to differentiate the amount of awareness information based on the viewer.

A number of general actons such as peeking, modifying, opening and selecting from pressure menus, and rate control are also well suited to pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pressure sensors can also be used to create a gestural language. Research done by us and other pressure researchers has shown that users can comfortably control 6 discrete levels of pressure. However, if the pressure space is monitored over time, a 2 dimensional pressure-time space is created. This allows for the design of pressure gestures, increasing the bandwidth of typical pressure sensors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contact <a href="mailto:jcechanowicz@gmail.com">Jared Cechanowicz</a> if you would like more information about this project.</p>', 'past', 23),

The solution that I propose is to provide more information about groupware users by enriching their embodiment through encoding state and context variables as visual augmentations on the embodiment.

This thesis examines the possibility of improving system-suggested help by adding knowledge about user expertise into the help system and eventually designing an expertise-sensitive help system.

However, standard network protocols do not provide the flexibility needed to support these different requirements (either providing too much reliability or too little), leading to poor performance on real-world networks. To address this problem, we investigated the use of an application-level networking technique called adaptive forward error correction (AFEC) for real-time groupware. AFEC can maintain a predefined level of reliability while avoiding the overhead of packet acknowledgement or retransmission. We analysed the requirements of typical real-time groupware systems and developed an AFEC technique to meet these needs. We tested the new technique in an experiment that measured message reliability and latency using TCP, plain UDP, UDP with non-adaptive FEC, and UDP with our AFEC scheme, under several simulated network conditions. Our results show that for awareness messages that can tolerate some loss, FEC approaches keep latency at nearly the plain-UDP level while dramatically improving reliability. In addition, adaptive FEC is the only technique that can maintain a specified level of reliability and also minimize delay as network conditions change.
