However, instrumenting software to collect usage data is a time-intensive task that often requires technical expertise as well as an understanding of the usability issues to be explored. We have developed a new technique for software instrumentation that removes the need for programming. <i>Interactive Usability Instrumentation</i> (IUI) allows usability evaluators to work directly with a system''s interface to specify what components and what events should be logged. Evaluators are able to create higher-level abstractions on the events they log and are provided with real-time feedback on how events are logged. As a proof of the IUI concept, we have created the UMARA system, an instrumentation system that is enabled by recent advances in aspect-oriented programming. UMARA allows users to instrument software without the need for additional coding, and provides tools for specification, data collection, and data analysis. We report on the use of UMARA in the instrumentation of two large open-source projects; our experiences show that IUI can substantially simplify the process of log-based usability evaluation.', 2009, NULL, 0, '', '', '', 'Pittsburgh, PA', '', '', '', 'Proceedings of the ACM SIGCHI Symposium on Engineering Interactive Computer Systems Systems (EICS 2009)', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

The system uses a special digital pen, which writes ''real'' ink on the palettes while functioning as a digital input device on the interactive surfaces. The palettes can be seamlessly integrated into existing applications, be appropriated by the user to suit different input requirements, and support new interaction styles across multiple surfaces, palettes and users.', 2008, NULL, 0, '', '', '', '', '55-58', '10.1145/1347390.1347404', '', 'Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Tangible and Embedded interaction (TEI ''08)', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

In this paper, we introduce a new set of heuristics that can be used to carry out usability inspections of video games. The heuristics were developed to help identify usability problems in both early and functional game prototypes. We developed the heuristics by analyzing PC game reviews from a popular gaming website, and the review set covered 108 different games and included 18 from each of 6 major game genres. We analyzed the reviews and identified twelve common classes of usability problems seen in games. We developed ten usability heuristics based on the problem categories, and they describe how common game usability problems can be avoided. A preliminary evaluation of the heuristics suggests that they help identify game-specific usability problems that can easily be overlooked otherwise.', 2008, NULL, 0, '', '', '', '', '1453-1462', '10.1145/1357054.1357282', '', 'Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2008)', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

One of the main benefits of this process is that people can be more sensitive to issues of privacy and interruption while they are moving towards interaction. However, on-line communication tools do not provide this subtlety, and often lead to unwanted interruptions. We have developed a prototype message system called OpenMessenger (OM) that adds the idea of gradual initiation of interaction to online communication. OpenMessenger provides multiple levels of awareness about people, and provides notification to those about whom information is being gathered. OpenMessenger allows people to negotiate interaction in a richer fashion than is possible with any other current messaging system. Preliminary evaluation data suggest the utility of the approach, but also shows that there are a number of issues yet to be resolved in this area.', 2008, NULL, 0, '', '', '', '', '1661-1664', '10.1145/1357054.1357313', '', 'Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2008)', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Arrow-based techniques such as <i>City Lights</i> convey only direction. <i>Halo</i> conveys direction and distance, but is susceptible to clutter resulting from overlapping halos. We present <i>Wedge</i>, a visualization technique that conveys direction and distance, yet avoids overlap and clutter. Wedge represents each off-screen location using an acute isosceles triangle: the tip coincides with the off-screen locations, and the two corners are located onscreen. A wedge conveys location awareness primarily by means of its two <i>legs</i> pointing towards the target. Wedges avoid overlap programmatically by repelling each other, causing them to rotate until overlap is resolved. As a result, wedges can be applied to numbers and configurations of targets that would lead to clutter if visualized using halos. We report on a user study comparing Wedge and Halo for three off-screen tasks. Participants were significantly more accurate when using Wedge than when using Halo.', 2008, NULL, 0, '', '', '', '', '787-796', '10.1145/1357054.1357179', '', 'Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2008)', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(7, 'conference', 'Targeting Across Displayless Space', NULL, 'Multi-monitor displays and multi-display environments are now common. Cross-display cursor movement, in which a user moves the pointer from one display to another, occurs frequently in these settings. There are several techniques for supporting this kind of movement, and these differ in the way that they deal with displayless space (the physical space between displays). Stitching is the method used by most operating systems; in this technique, the cursor jumps from the edge of one display directly into the next display. In contrast, Mouse Ether maps the motor space of the mouse exactly to the physical space of the displays, meaning that the cursor has to travel across displayless space until it reaches the next display. To determine which of these approaches is best for cross-display movement, we carried out a study comparing Stitching, Mouse Ether, and a variant of Mouse Ether with Halo for off-screen feedback.

To support informal collaboration, groupware must be designed and built differently. We introduce the idea of <i>community-based groupware (CBG)</i>, in which groupware is organized around groups of people working independently, rather than shared applications, documents, or virtual places. Community-based groupware provides support for three things that are fundamental to informal collaboration: awareness of others and their individual work, lightweight means for initiating interactions, and the ability to move into closely-coupled collaboration when necessary. We demonstrate three prototypes that illustrate the ideas behind CBG, and argue that this way of organizing groupware supports informal collaboration better than other existing approaches.', 2008, NULL, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '10.3217/jucs-014-09-1411', '', 'Journal of Universal Computer Science', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

In this research, I explore one kind of awareness called workspace awareness,\nand investigate techniques for supporting it in groupware interfaces.

Since community elders are mostly non-interactive with technology, new technologies that require explicit interaction will not be readily patronized by the community. Furthermore, due to factors including age and culture, elders are unlikely to use new technologies of any kind. Thus, any improvement on the paper-based interaction paradigm must satisfy researcher''s needs for a simple map navigation interface as well as greater ease and accuracy in recording interactions while maintaining as low a technological profile as possible.\r\nWe interviewed four researchers in biology and veterinary medicine whose primary research takes place in the north with community members to determine the most effective mechanisms for presenting and eliciting geographical information during northern research without altering the existing interaction paradigm.

We first discuss related work of user experience (UX) and player experience models, based on which we propose a three-layer framework of GX. For each layer, a number of measurement methodologies are listed and our focus is put on physiological and technical metrics for game evaluation. Finally, we point out the potential use of this framework within the field of game-based learning and serious gaming for sports and health.', 2010, NULL, 0, '9', '2', '', 'Darmstadt, Germany', 'http://iacss.org/index.php?id=96', '', '', 'International Journal of Computer Science in Sport', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Pointing gestures can be complex and subtle, however, and pointing is much more difficult in the virtual world. In order to improve the richness of interaction in CVEs, it is important to provide better support for pointing and deictic reference, and a first step in this support is to determine how well people can interpret the direction that another person is pointing. To investigate this question, we carried out two studies. The first identified several ways that people point towards distant targets, and established that not all pointing requires high accuracy. This suggested that natural CVE pointing could potentially be successful; but no knowledge is available about whether even moderate accuracy is possible in CVEs. Therefore, our second study looked more closely at how accurately people can produce and interpret the direction of pointing gestures in CVEs. We found that although people are more accurate in the real world, the differences are smaller than expected; our results show that deixis can be successful in CVEs for many pointing situations, and provide a foundation for more comprehensive support of deictic pointing.', 2010, NULL, 0, '', '', '', 'Atlanta, GA, USA', '1029-1038', '10.1145/1753326.1753480', '', 'Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2010)', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Researching gameplay experience is done mainly in the science and technology (e.g., human-computer interaction, physiological and entertainment computing) and social science (e.g., media psychology, psychophysiology, and communication sciences) research communities. This thesis is located at the intersection of these research areas, bringing together emerging methodological and scientific approaches from these multi-faceted communities for an affective ludology; a novel take on game analysis and design with focus on the player.\r\n\r\nThe thesis contributes to game research with three important results:\r\n\r\nthe establishment of a objective/subjective correlation methodology founded on psychophysiological methods,\r\nthe creation of a formal theoretical framework in which to conduct user experience (UX) research related to games, and\r\nthe combination of results regarding cognitive and emotional factors for describing, defining, and classifying the interactive relationship between players and games.\r\nTwo approaches for measuring gameplay experience are used in this thesis. First, objective assessment of physiological user responses together with automated event-logging techniques, so called game metrics, allows collecting essential player- and game-related variables for a comprehensive understanding of their interaction. Second, using psychometric questionnaires allows a reliable assessment of players'' subjective emotion and cognition during gameplay. The benefit of psychophysiological methods is that they are non-intrusive, covert, reliable, and objective. To fully understand psychophysiological results, a correlation between subjective gameplay experience ratings and psychophysiological responses is necessary and has been done in this thesis and prior work it builds on.\r\n\r\nThis thesis explores objective and subjective assessment of gameplay experience in several experiments. The experiments focus on:\r\n\r\nlevel design implications from psychophysiological and questionnaire measurements,\r\nthe impact of form and age on subjective gameplay experience,\r\nthe impact of game audio and sound on objective and subjective player responses, and\r\nthe impact of game interaction design on and the relationship between experience and electroencephalographic measures.\r\nIn addition, the thesis includes a theoretical framework for UX research in games, which classifies gameplay experience along the dimensions of abstraction and time. One remaining conceptual and empirical challenge for this framework is the huge variety of vaguely defined experiential phenomena, such as immersion, flow, presence, and engagement. However, the results from the experimental studies show that by establishing correlations between psychophysiological responses and questionnaire data, we are approaching a better, scientifically grounded, understanding of gameplay experience.\r\n\r\nMany possibilities open from here. More detailed analyses of cognition will help us understand to what extent gameplay experience depends on emotional or cognitive processing. In addition, the inclusion of more complex and detailed gameplay metrics data together with psychophysiological metrics will enable a comprehensive analysis of player behavior, attention, and motivation.

To address this problem, we propose calibration games that gather calibration data in an engaging and entertaining manner.

To evaluate the approach, we developed three calibration games and com- pared them to standard procedures.

Biofeedback games have seen success when used in special populations - for example, to help children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) learn to focus or to help children with anxiety learn to manage their stress levels - however, creating engaging biofeedback games is difficult because they traditionally alter a game''s mechanics to create the feedback loop. This means that each game must be custom designed, which is both expensive and time consuming. Thus, biofeedback games tend to be toy applications that don''t hold a user''s interest in the long term, which is a problem because biofeedback training requires repeated exposure.\r\n\r\nWe propose to solve the problem of creating good biofeedback games by closing the biofeedback loop by altering game graphics instead of game mechanics.

The amount of disruption varies in a continuous manner, is determined during play, and is driven by the physiological sensors.

To address this, we developed SPRWeb, a tool that recolours websites to preserve subjective responses and improve colour differentiability - thus enabling users with CVD to have similar online experiences. To develop SPRWeb, we extended existing models of non-CVD subjective responses to CVD, then used this extended model to steer the recolouring process.

Recoloring tools have been developed to address the problem, but current recolorers are limited in that they work from a model of only one type of congenital CVD (i.e., dichromatism). This model does not adequately describe many other forms of CVD (e.g., more common congenital deficiencies such as anomalous trichromacy, acquired deficiencies such as cataracts or age-related yellowing of the lens, or temporary deficiencies such as wearing tinted glasses or working in bright sunlight), and so standard recolorers work poorly in many situations. In this article we describe an alternate approach that can address these limitations. The new approach, called Situation-Specific Modeling (SSM), constructs a model of a specific user''s color differentiation abilities in a specific situation, and uses that model as the basis for recoloring digital presentations. As a result, SSM can inherently handle all types of CVD, whether congenital, acquired, or environmental. In this article we describe and evaluate several models that are based on the SSM approach. Our first model of individual color differentiation (called ICD-1) works in RGB color space, and a user study showed it to be accurate and robust (both for users with and without congenital CVD). However, three aspects of ICD-1 were identified as needing improvement: the calibration step needed to build the situation-specific model, and the prediction steps used in recoloring were too slow for real-world use; and the results of the model''s predictions were too coarse for some uses. We therefore developed three further techniques: ICD-2 reduces the time needed to calibrate the model; ICD-3 reduces the time needed to make predictions with the model; and ICD-4 provides additional information about the degree of differentiability in a prediction. Our final result is a model of the user''s color perception that handles any type of CVD, can be calibrated in two minutes, and can find replacement colors in near-real time (~1 second for a 64-color image).

Even though information seeking is extremely common, there are many times when these tasks are unsuccessful, because the information found is less than ideal or the task could have been completed more efficiently. In unsuccessful information-seeking tasks, there are often other people who have knowledge or experience that could help improve task success. However, information seekers do not typically look for help from others, because tasks can often be completed alone (even if inefficiently). One of the problems is that web tools provide people with few opportunities to learn from one another''s experiences in ways that would allow them to improve their success. This dissertation presents the idea of social feedback. Social feedback is based on the theory of social learning, which describes how people learn from observing others. In social feedback, observational learning is enabled through the mechanism of interaction history - the traces of activity people create as they interact with the Web. Social feedback systems collect and display interaction history to allow information seekers to learn how to complete their tasks more successfully by observing how other people have behaved in similar situations. The dissertation outlines the design of two social-feedback systems, and describes two studies that demonstrate the real world applicability and feasibility of the idea. The first system supports global learning, by allowing people to learn new search skills and techniques that improve information seeking success in many different tasks. The second system supports local learning, in which people learn how to accomplish specific tasks more effectively and more efficiently. Two further studies are conducted to explore potential real-world challenges to the successful deployment of social feedback systems, such as the privacy concerns associated with the collection and sharing of interaction history. These studies show that social feedback systems can be deployed successfully for supporting real world information seeking tasks.

These systems often implement relative forms of ray-cast pointing, in which the user simply points a hand-held input device towards targets on the screen. Ray-casting interaction is easy for novices to learn and understand, but this technique often suffers from accuracy problems: for example, hand jitter, arm fatigue, calibration drift, or lack of skill can all reduce people''s ability to acquire and select on-screen targets. In this paper, we analyse and evaluate the idea of target assistance as a way to address the accuracy problems of ray-cast pointing. Although several assistance schemes have been proposed for mouse-based pointing, these ideas have not been tested in distant-pointing settings, and there is little knowledge available to guide design in this increasingly common interaction scenario. To establish this basic design knowledge, we carried out four studies of relative ray-casting using three different target assistance techniques - two motor-space techniques (sticky targets and a novel form of target gravity), and one acquisition-feedback technique that combined visual, tactile, and auditory feedback. Our first three studies tested each assistance technique separately, to explore how different parameters for each method affected performance and perceptibility.

Deictic pointing is important in the real world; it is also important in collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) because CVEs are 3D virtual environments that resemble the real world. CVEs connect people from different locations, allowing them to communicate and collaborate remotely. However, the interaction and communication capabilities of CVEs are not as good as those in the real world. In CVEs, people interact with each other using avatars (the visual representations of users). One problem of avatars is that they are not expressive enough when compare to what we can do in the real world. In particular, deictic pointing has many limitations and is not well supported.\r\n\r\nThis dissertation focuses on improving the expressiveness of distant pointing--where referents are out of reach--in desktop CVEs. This is done by developing a framework that guides the design and development of pointing techniques; by identifying important aspects of distant pointing through observation of how people point at distant referents in the real world; by designing, implementing, and evaluating distant-pointing techniques; and by providing a set of guidelines for the design of distant pointing in desktop CVEs.\r\n\r\nThe evaluations of distant-pointing techniques examine whether pointing without extra visual effects (natural pointing) has sufficient accuracy; whether people can control free arm movement (free pointing) along with other avatar actions; and whether free and natural pointing are useful and valuable in desktop CVEs.\r\n\r\nOverall, this research provides better support for deictic pointing in CVEs by improving the expressiveness of distant pointing.

In order to get these benefits, it is recommended that people perform at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a day; however, many people do not get the recommended amount of exercise per day, which can result in health problems such as obesity and chronic disease. In this thesis, we propose a new genre of games called casual exergames, which we define as exergames that are designed to motivate people to exercise in small chunks of time multiple times throughout the day. Casual exergames have three advantages. First, games have been shown to have a strong motivation pull to play (i.e., people enjoy playing games), and casual games - those designed to be played in small chunks of time - have seen huge market success. Thus, we feel that applying casual game design to exergames will provide players with an enjoyable experience while performing physical activity. Second, research supports the approach of breaking exercise into small chunks, as the physical benefits of three moderate-intensity short bouts of physical activity (each lasting about 10 minutes) are similar to those of one continuous 30-minute bout. Thus, there should be physical benefits of casual exergame play. Third, short bouts of exercise have been shown to yield acute cognitive benefits. Thus a well-designed casual exergame should also produce measurable benefits to cognition. Following this approach, we designed and implemented a causal exergame called GrabApple, using the Microsoft Kinect sensor to detect body movement. Through the evaluation of GrabApple (carried out in three research studies), we show that a well-designed casual exergame can: 1) yield physical activity levels (similar to exercise on a treadmill) that meet the guidelines for moderate-intensity physical activity; 2) produce significant acute benefits to cognition over playing a sedentary version of the game; and 3) be integrated into a school setting with the potential of helping kids achieve physical activity thresholds, while also helping them to refocus throughout the day.

The goal of these policies is to enable the user to make informed decisions about the disclosure of personal information in web-based transactions.

The problem addressed in this thesis is that even with machine-readable policies and current user agents, it is still difficult for users to determine the cause and origin of a conflict between privacy preferences and privacy policies. The problem arises partly because current standards operate at the page level: they do not allow a fine-grained treatment of conformance down to the level of a specific field in a web form. In this thesis the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) is extended to enable field-level comparisons, field-specific conformance displays, and faster access to additional field-specific conformance information.

The framework was developed to provide designers with support during each of these stages so that they can consider important characteristics of loosely coupled work practice while carrying out design for the target group.

Using the information gathered by looking through the window, they can determine whether it is a good time to initiate a conversation with the occupant. There are, however, two problems with ordinary glass windows. First, there are times when the window does not provide enough information, such as when the occupant is away. Second, there is potential to violate the occupantâ€™s privacy; as a result of the privacy risk, people often cover their windows entirely. If office windows are to work efficiently as a support for collaboration, there must be a balance between awareness and privacy. In this research, I augmented the functions of a physical office window with a computer-mediated replacement called the Magic Window. The Magic Window collects video of the occupant, mediates the signal in various ways, and then presents the altered view on a screen that replaces the glass window. The Magic Window provides a better balance of awareness and privacy in office settings by allowing occupant to differentiate the amount of awareness information based on the viewer. The Magic Window system was tested in an eight-month field trial. The trial showed that the augmented window did provide a balance of privacy and awareness, and also raised a number of issues that will aid the design of future design of co-present media spaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contact <a href="mailto:hyk564@cs.usask.ca">James Kim</a> if you would like more information about this project.</p>', 'past', 28),

In this paper we propose an alternate approach for improving efficiency--an automatic compression system that transparently minimizes verbose formats.

While that general approach is successful in large messages, small messages have too little intra-message redundancy to be compressed in such a manner.

Our techniques focus on exploiting this intra-message redundancy to drastically, and quickly, reduce message size.</p>', 'past', 26),

The problem addressed in this research is that it is difficult for groupware users to identify and distinguish other participants from their embodiments. The solution that I propose is to provide more information about groupware users by enriching their embodiment through encoding state and context variables as visual augmentations on the embodiment. Providing information about characteristics such as skill, expertise, and experience can be valuable for collaboration; increasing the information in visual embodiments will make it easier and more natural for collaborators to identify and differentiate others, coordinate activity, simplify communication, and find collaborators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current focus of this project is using parametric texture synthesis to encode information about embodiments. Textures may provide a more natural and intuitive way to present information to the user by taking advantage of real world mappings.

Although system-suggested help assists users in completing their tasks quickly, user response to unsolicited advice from their applications has been lukewarm. One such problem is lack of knowledge of system-suggested help about the user''s expertise with the task they are currently doing. This thesis examines the possibility of improving system-suggested help by adding knowledge about user expertise into the help system and eventually designing an expertise-sensitive help system. An expertise-sensitive help system would detect user expertise dynamically and regularly so that systems could recommend help overtly to novices, subtly to average and poor users, and not at all to experts. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOur work makes several advances in this area through a series of four experiments. In the first experiment, we show that users respond differently to help interruptions depending on their expertise with a task. Having established that user response to helpful interruptions varies with expertise level, in the second experiment we create a four-level classifier of task expertise with an accuracy of 90%. To present helpful interruptions differently to novice, poor, and average users, we need to design three interrupting notifications that vary in their attentional draw. In experiment three, we investigate a number of options and choose three icons. Finally, in experiment four, we investigate the expertise model and three interrupting notifications into an expertise-sensitive system-suggested help program, and investigate the user response. Together, these four experiments show that users value helpful interruptions when their expertise with a task is low, and that an expertise-sensitive help system that presents helpful interruptions with attentional draw that matches user expertise is effective and valuable.\r\n</p>', 'active', 21),

For example, obesity rates triples among boys and doubled among girls aged 7-13 between 1981 and 1996.

Video games are, in contrast, a highly popular activity, and are now played in more than 68% of American households. Video games are no longer an activity purely for young males: the average age of players is 35, and 40% of game players are women.  The primary goal of this project is to determine whether video gaming can be used to help motivate people to begin and maintain a program of physical activity. While there are an increasing number of commercial products that aim to do exactly this (e.g., Wii Fit, EA Sports Active), relatively little is known about the principles of how to design effective exercise video games. We will address the questions of what design elements in games increase peoples'' motivation to become and remain physically active, and of whether these actually provide sufficient exercise to produce health benefits.\r\n<p>In one line of work, we investigate how real-world activities can be effectively integrated into a game. In another, we look at how walking can be used as a primary game mechanic for games aimed at kids and their parents.

Examples of groupware include: MSN messenger, Skype communication tool and multi-player games, such  as World of War Craft. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<strong>Disconnection Problems in Synchronous Groupware </strong>\r\n<p>\r\nParticipants in synchronous groupware frequently get disconnected due to power outage, network outage, network latency and explicit departure. The disconnected participants cannot continue with the ongoing collaboration activities. When they rejoin the session, they might not able to ''catch up'' with other peers and experience different user-level problems, such as misinterpretation and confusion about the changes that occurred during their absence.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCurrent research shows that when reconnected users are able to see missed information as feedback in an understandable format (e.g. seeing a quick replay of the missed events), they can ''catch-up'' with the ongoing collaboration. However, adapting feedback mechanism in groupware is difficult for the developers as they need to handle various disconnection scenarios and timeframes. Existing techniques only handle a limited set of disconnection scenarios and there is little support for handling different timeframes. Therefore developers must have a deep understanding of the issues underlying disconnection, and need to do all development tasks relating to disconnection from scratch.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n <strong> Solution </strong>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn order to  address the disconnection problems, we are deeply investigating disconnection in synchronous groupware. The investigation resulted in comprehensive design knowledge around the engineering process of constructing disconnection aware groupware applications.

However, standard network protocols do not provide the flexibility needed to support these different requirements (either providing too much reliability or too little), leading to poor performance on real-world networks. To address this problem, we investigated the use of an application-level networking technique called adaptive forward error correction (AFEC) for real-time groupware. AFEC can maintain a predefined level of reliability while avoiding the overhead of packet acknowledgement or retransmission. We analysed the requirements of typical real-time groupware systems and developed an AFEC technique to meet these needs. We tested the new technique in an experiment that measured message reliability and latency using TCP, plain UDP, UDP with non-adaptive FEC, and UDP with our AFEC scheme, under several simulated network conditions. Our results show that for awareness messages that can tolerate some loss, FEC approaches keep latency at nearly the plain-UDP level while dramatically improving reliability. In addition, adaptive FEC is the only technique that can maintain a specified level of reliability and also minimize delay as network conditions change. Our study shows that groupware AFEC can be a useful tool for improving the real-world performance and usability of real-time groupware.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Publication</h3>\r\n<p>See <a href="/publications/view.php?id=283">the publication page</a> for more information and a link to the PDF copy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Toolkit download</h3>\r\n<p><a href="/software/gw-afec.zip">The toolkit</a> is available for download, including a simple whiteboard telepointer client-server project which shows the toolkit in use.</p>', 'active', 5),
