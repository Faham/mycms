<tr><td style="width: 550px">
CMPT 105 will provide an introduction to ideas and concepts in both computer science and the design of interactive systems. Concepts in computing will be explored using interactive multimedia systems as the focus. Basic concepts in design, 
visual layout, and interaction will be introduced.

<p>
No background in programming or computer science is needed to take this class! We'll teach you everything you need to know. We're particularly interested in people who have interests in art, music, games, collaboration, and interaction.

<p>
Some of the things we'll be doing in this class:
<ul>
<li>Basic Interaction: simple animation, creating sprites, making the computer 
respond to the user&#39;s actions<li>Basics of multimedia: images, sound, and video, 
representation and encoding, types and formats
<li>More advanced interaction: making the computer respond differently depending 
on different conditions, decisions and basic problem solving<li>Basics of 
computing: how computers work, input and output devices, pixels and screens<li>Design basics: users and tasks, game design concepts, prototyping and storyboarding, and the iterative design process 
<li>Working with data: loading and manipulating images, looping through image data, working with pixels
<li>Working with the Internet: networks, the internet, and the web; commands for getting and working with web pages
<li>Graphical User Interfaces: user input, basic widgets, building GUIs, and visual design principles
<li>Putting it all together: building an interactive game or story
</ul>
