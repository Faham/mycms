<tr><td>
The department of Computer Science offers several classes related to Human-Computer Interaction. In 2008/2009, we will offer two new courses at the first-year level, CMPT 105 and CMPT 106. These classes will provide an introduction to interactive systems, design, and computing. These courses are intended for students who want to focus on interaction and design, students who want a more gradual introduction to programming, or students who are not majoring in computer science but who still want some computing in their program.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>
CMPT 105 will provide an introduction to ideas and concepts in both computer science and the design of interactive systems. Concepts in computing such as algorithms, problem solving, and programming will be explored using interactive multimedia systems as the focus. Basic concepts in design and interaction, such as the interaction cycle, event-based behaviour, and prototyping will be introduced.

<p>
No background in programming or computer science is needed to take this class! We'll teach you everything you need to know. We're particularly interested in people who have interests in art, music, games, collaboration, and interaction.

<p>
Some of the things we'll be doing in this class:
<ul>
<li>Basic Interaction: the interaction cycle, creating sprites and behaviours, handling events, and simple animation
<li>Basics of multimedia: representation and encoding, types and formats, images, sound, and video
<li>More advanced interaction: conditional behaviour, decisions and basic problem solving, and algorithms
<li>Basics of computing: how computers work, input and output devices, pixels and screens, libraries and APIs
<li>Even more interaction: complex behaviours, responding to input, and storing information in variables
<li>Design basics: users and tasks, game design concepts, prototyping and storyboarding, and the iterative design process 
<li>Working with data: loading and manipulating images, looping through image data, working with pixels
<li>Working with the Internet: networks, the internet, and the web; commands for getting and working with web pages
<li>Graphical User Interfaces: user input, basic widgets, building GUIs, and visual design principles
<li>Putting it all together: building an interactive game or story
</ul>

<tr><td>
CMPT 106 continues where 105 leaves off, and introduces additional concepts in computer science and interaction design. It will cover computing topics such as representation of data, use of expressions, development of subprograms, and creation and manipulation of graphical images. Design topics will include consideration of narrative, game rules, collaboration, and animation.

<p>
Here's what 106 will look at:
<ul>
<li>Types of interactive systems: genres and approaches to interaction
<li>Representations of data: variables and data types, collections, and files
<li>Narrative: stories and storytelling, pace and flow, visual attention, and creation of experiences in interactive systems
<li>2D Graphics: basics of graphical displays, bitmap vs. vector-based drawing, graphics APIs and basic shapes, and basic graphics algorithms
<li>Animation: basic concepts of 2D animation, implementing animation with timers, and autonomous behaviour
<li>Expressions: arithmetic and conditional expressions, function calls, and simulating physics
<li>Game Design: game genres, challenge and flow, and elements of games
<li>Collaboration and multi-user systems: communication, coordination, awareness; design for groups
<li>Subprograms: creating subprograms and modular design
<li>Game rules and balance: rule design, game balance, iterative design and testing
<li>Putting it all together: building an interactive game
</ul>
