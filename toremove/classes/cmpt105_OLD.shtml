</td></tr>
<tr><td style="width: 550px">
CMPT 105 will provide an introduction to ideas and concepts in both computer science and the design of interactive systems. Concepts in computing such as algorithms, problem solving, and programming will be explored using interactive multimedia systems as the focus. Basic concepts in design and interaction, such as the interaction cycle, event-based behaviour, and prototyping will be introduced.

<p>
No background in programming or computer science is needed to take this class! We'll teach you everything you need to know. We're particularly interested in people who have interests in art, music, games, collaboration, and interaction.

<p>
Some of the things we'll be doing in this class:
<ul>
<li>Basic Interaction: the interaction cycle, creating sprites and behaviours, handling events, and simple animation
<li>Basics of multimedia: representation and encoding, types and formats, images, sound, and video
<li>More advanced interaction: conditional behaviour, decisions and basic problem solving, and algorithms
<li>Basics of computing: how computers work, input and output devices, pixels and screens, libraries and APIs
<li>Even more interaction: complex behaviours, responding to input, and storing information in variables
<li>Design basics: users and tasks, game design concepts, prototyping and storyboarding, and the iterative design process 
<li>Working with data: loading and manipulating images, looping through image data, working with pixels
<li>Working with the Internet: networks, the internet, and the web; commands for getting and working with web pages
<li>Graphical User Interfaces: user input, basic widgets, building GUIs, and visual design principles
<li>Putting it all together: building an interactive game or story
</ul>
