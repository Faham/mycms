<p><br><br>Two new classes in Interactive Systems and Game Design will be offered in 2008-2009: 
<strong>CMPT 105</strong> and <strong>CMPT 106</strong>. These classes will provide an 
introduction to interactive systems, design, and computing – no previous experience in 
Computer Science is required, and the classes can be taken by first-year students.</p>


<p><center><strong>CMPT 105 and 106 can be used as Science credits for Arts students.</strong></center></p>


<p>These classes are for students who want to focus on interaction and design, students 
who want a more gradual introduction to programming, and students who are not majoring 
in Computer Science but want some computing in their program. </p>

<p><strong><em>How to Register:</em></strong> These are regular U of S classes that will 
start in September 2008 (CMPT 105) and January 2009 (CMPT 106). The official titles are:</p>
<ul><li><em><strong>CMPT 105.3: Introduction to Computing and Interactive Systems</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>CMPT 106.3: Design and Construction of Games and Interactive Systems</strong></em></li></ul>


<p>These courses have only recently been created, and so they do not appear in the offical U 
of S course calendar – but they are fully-approved regular classes. You can register through 
PAWS as you would for any other course. Please note that CMPT 105 is a prerequisite for CMPT 106.</p>

<p>For more information on the courses, visit the course pages for 
<a href="cmpt105.shtml">CMPT 105</a> and <a href="cmpt106.shtml">CMPT 106</a>.</p>
