<H1>GT 3.0.1: The Groupware Toolkit</H1>

<P>The GT library is a groupware toolkit with two goals: to simplify
the development of real-time distributed groupware, and to improve
the performance of distributed applications.  The toolkit makes it
simple to build groupware by taking care of networking and by
providing several high-level programming abstractions to deal with
communication and distributed data.  It is designed to speed the
development of simple groupware applications by allowing developers
to create distributed systems without the need to program lower-level
networking code.</P>

<P>This distribution includes the GT source code, prebuilt binaries,
and several demonstration programs.  The demonstration clients rely
upon a simple broadcasting server called the <TT>ClientRepeater</TT>;
you must ensure a copy is started.</P>

<P>GT is made available under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
v2.1 or later.  A copy of this license is included in the distribution as
<A HREF="LICENSE.txt"><TT>LICENSE.txt</TT></A>.</P>


<H2>Requirements</H2>
<UL>
<LI> GT has been developed against .NET 2.0.  Unfortunately
    the MSI installers seem to require .NET 3.5, due to GT being
    developed on VisualStudio 2008.  The actual DLLs are for .NET 2.0
    however.</LI>
<LI> We recommend you use a minimum of VS2005 SP1 for your own
    development as there are reports that the VS2005 installation
    prior to SP1 may have some faulty networking code.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Programming Model</H2>

<P>GT maintains a strong separation of clients and servers. Although
peer-to-peer systems can be implemented by having a node maintain both a
client and a server, this has not been GT's focus.</P>

<P>GT exports a notion of communicating across a set of typed channels.
Channels are typed to simplify sending structured information, such as
strings, bytes, objects, or session messages. There may be up to 255
different channels of each type. Each bit of structured information is
sent across as a message.</P>

<P>GT is designed to be non-blocking and, ideally, single-threaded.
Applications are required to periodically poll by calling the Update()
method on their GT interface (e.g., Client.Update() or Server.Update()).
Events are signalled through .NET events. Applications are responsible
for implementing equivalent blocking semantics when required.</P>

<H2>Architectural Overview</H2>

<P>GT is structured as a three-level architecture. At the top level is the
application level API, represented as instances of
<TT>GT.Net.Client</TT> and
<TT>GT.Net.Server</TT>.  Clients and servers export different
interfaces for handling messages.  These interfaces are nominally
connectionless.  At the middle level are <EM>connexions</EM> and
<EM>marshallers</EM>.  Connexions serve as an aggregation of the
different resources that can be used to communicate with a particular
endpoint; connexions are represented as instances of <TT>IConnexion</TT>.
Clients and servers use <EM>marshallers</EM> to convert messages
into a form suitable to be communicated across a network; marshallers
are represented as instances of <TT>GT.Net.IMarshaller</TT>.
At the lowest level are <EM>transports</EM> which serve to communicate
bundles of bytes to an endpoint using some network protocol; these
transports are represented as instances of <TT>ITransport</TT>.</P>

<P>GT supports communicating across a variety of networking mechanisms,
such as TCP and UDP. Applications can provide minimum delivery
requirements for particular channels and for individual messages, such
as whether a message must be sent across a networking mechanism with
guaranteed delivery, or particular ordering requirements. These
requirements are used to select a particular transport instance that
meet those requirements.</P>

<P>Both clients and servers are built using a configuration object,
<TT>GT.Net.ClientConfiguration</TT> for the client and
<TT>GT.Net.ServerConfiguration</TT> for the server. Sample
configurations are provided in <TT>GT.Net.DefaultClientConfiguration</TT>
and <TT>GT.Net.DefaultServerConfiguration</TT>; these configurations
are intended to serve only as examples and may change between
releases.  The examples should be copied and adapted for your
particular application needs.</P>

<H3>The GT Client</H3>

<P>A client encapsulates the communication to different servers. Clients
export a channel as a typed stream. We currently support 4 types of
streams: strings (<TT>IStringStream</TT>), binary arrays
(<TT>IBinaryStream</TT>), objects
(<TT>IObjectStream</TT>), and session events (<TT>ISessionStream</TT>).
GT also supports tuple streams, which provide automatically updating
structures.</P>

<P>The main interface to GT Client is through instances of the
<TT>GT.Net.Client</TT> class and the various stream instances.</P>

<P>Channels have quality-of-services requirements, described using a
<TT>ChannelDeliveryRequirements</TT> object. These QoS requirements are used to
find an appropriate transport able to meet those requirements. These QoS
requirements may be overridden on a per-message basis using a
<TT>MessageDeliveryRequirements</TT> object. Care must be taken for
requirements specifying an aggregation level of
<TT>MessageAggregation.Aggregatable</TT>: the user is responsible for
periodically flushing the channel manually.  These messages will be
flushed by the periodic client/server ping, though this is usually
scheduled to occur once every 10 seconds</P>


<H3>The GT Server</H3>

<P>Servers provide a more event-driven interface. As servers must scale to
multiple clients, they are generally required to be more performant.</P>

<H3>GT Marshallers</H3>

<P>Marshallers have the responsibility of breaking object graphs into
bytes, forms that can be transported across a network connection or
written and read from disk. As multiple messages may be bundled together
into a transport-level packet, a marshaller is responsible for placing
message boundaries. This typically means that the marshaller should
either write an explicit end-of-message indicator or tack a prefix to
the content with a message length.</P>

<P>GT provides a standard object marshaller that uses the .NET
Serialization. There are two variants of the marshaller.  The first
variant is a lightweight marshaller
(<TT>LightweightDotNetSerializingMarshaller</TT>) that unmarshals
only system-level messages, and leaves all application messages
received as uninterpreted bytes; this is helpful for servers such
as the ClientRepeater by avoiding any unnecessary latency by dropping
all but the most basic functionality.  The heavier-weight marshaller
(<TT>DotNetSerializingMarshaller</TT>) uses the .NET serialization
facilities.</P>

<P>We have also provided a proof-of-concept implementation of the
<EM>general message compressor</EM>, an adaptively compressing
marshaller that is well suited to marshalling data with repetitive
structure between messages.  This scheme is described in:</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Although GMC is fully functional, it is currently only supported
across reliable and ordered transports.</P>

<P>GT Marshallers should never produce 0-byte messages. Marshallers should
throw a <TT>GT.Net.MarshallingException</TT> exception on error.</P>

<H3>GT Transports</H3>

<P>Transports are responsible for carrying a set of bytes, called a
<TT>Packet</TT>, to some remote endpoint. Transports describe their
transportation characteristics which are used to match against a
channel or message's required QoS requirements.</P>

<P>GT Transports should throw a <TT>GT.Net.TransportError</TT> when
requested to send a 0-byte message.</P>

<H3>Communicating Errors and Exceptions</H3>

<P>GT uses both exceptions and an error event mechanism to communicate
errors as they occur. There are several situations where errors may
occur:</P>
<UL>
<LI> Errors due to GT programming errors</LI>
<LI> Errors due to application programming errors</LI>
<LI> Errors due to application violation of GT calling conventions
    and APIs</LI>
<LI> Errors due to resource issues (i.e., all the above, but on the
    remote side)</LI>
<LI> Errors due to network problems.</LI>
</UL>
<P>GT will raise exceptions on API violations or truly exceptional
occurrences. Otherwise exceptions and errors are reported using the
error event mechanism.</P>

<P>The exceptions currently defined are:</P>
<DL>
<DT>System.ArgumentException, System.ArgumentNullException</DT>
<DD>Thrown with invalid arguments</DD>

<DT>GT.ContractViolation</DT>
<DD>Thrown when documented conventions/contracts/constraints are
    violated; these are situations where there aren't particular
    problems with arguments to a method</DD>

<DT>GT.InvalidStateException</DT>
<DD>Thrown when a component is used when in an
    invalid state (i.e., it has been stopped or disposed)</DD>

<DT>GT.Net.MarshallingException</DT>
<DD>Thrown when an error occurs during marshalling / unmarshalling</DD>

<DT>GT.Net.TransportError</DT>
<DD>Thrown when an error has occurred when communicating across a
    particular transport</DD>

<DT>GT.Net.CannotConnectException</DT>
<DD>Thrown when there was a problem connecting to a remote endpoint.
    Raised only when connecting, such as when getting a stream.</DD>

<DT>GT.Net.CannotSendMessagesError</DT>
<DD>Thrown when a set of messages could not be sent for
    various reasons. This is a composite exception.  The exception
    contains the set of messages that could not be sent; the handler
    can decide whether to re-send the messages.</DD>

<DT>GT.Net.NoMatchingTransport</DT>
<DD>Thrown when there is no transport that meets the
    message/channel delivery requirements</DD>

</DL>

<P>All GT exceptions and error events have an assessment as to their
severity:</P>

<DL>
<DT>Fatal</DT>
<DD>an error has occurred such that GT cannot continue in its operation.</DD>

<DT>Error</DT>
<DD>an error has occurred; the application will likely be able to
    continue, but GT functionality may be significantly limited.</DD>

<DT>Warning</DT>
<DD>an error has occurred such that GT is able to continue, but the
    application's functionality may be compromised</DD>

<DT>Information</DT>
<DD>a problem has occurred but has been dealt with; the error
    is being reported purely for information</DD>
</DL>
<P>Errors/exceptions reported using the error event mechanism are notified
using an <TT>ErrorSummary</TT> object. The <TT>ErrorSummary</TT> provides:</P>
<UL>
<LI> a descriptive summary code (a SummaryErrorCode, described
    below);</LI>
<LI> a descriptive message as to the cause and implications of the error,
    hopefully suitable for displaying to the user;</LI>
<LI> the severity of the error (which may be different from the severity of
    the underlying exception);</LI>
<LI> the context of the error, such as exception that was raised, if
    available.</LI>
</UL>
<P>There are currently 5 different forms of a SummaryErrorCode which
represent the implications of the error:</P>
<DL>
<DT>UserException</DT>
<DD>there was an exception trapped when running application-provided
    code (e.g., thrown from an event listener);</DD>

<DT>RemoteUnavailable</DT>
<DD>the remote system could not be contacted;</DD>

<DT>MessagesCannotBeSent</DT>
<DD>there were message(s) that could not be sent; these messages
    have been dequeued and are available in the exception;</DD>

<DT>InvalidIncomingMessage</DT>
<DD>there was an error unmarshalling a message from
    an incoming connection;</DD>

<DT>TransportBacklogged</DT>
<DD>a transport has too much information awaiting; the data has been
    queued for later transmission, but may be significantly delayed.</DD>
